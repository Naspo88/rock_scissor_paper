# ABOUT
This application is a simple web page to let user to play the famous game ‘Rock Scissor Paper’.

The User Interface is really simple, it shows a little header where is write the title of the game and who develop the application. Above of it there is the game itself.

The first row contains the score that is updated during the game. Above there is the game play view. It starts with two question marks waiting for user move choice. At the bottom, there are the possible moves of the game (the hand with rock, scissor and paper).

Clicking in one the possible move, the code take a random move for the computer and show both move in the gameplay view. Show who wins the current match and assign the point to the score view.

The game end when one of the players arrive to 5 points. At this moment appear a popup that show who win the game, the final score and a button to reset the game.

# What missing
I spent 3 hours to build this simple application, focusing on make a solid, clean and easy-to-read code that work without bugs. 
With more time, it would be funny to improve the UX/UI of the application, to give the user a more playable graphic.

Other ideas I had before starting the project were to give the user the possibility to choose the end-game score, now fixed to 5. Other features would be to permit the multiplayer game.

Finally, it would be funny to extend the game (with the extension of Sam Kass, but more known from Sheldon Cooper of ‘The Big Bang Theory) with the addition of the moves ‘Spock’ and ‘Lizard’.
